This repository will contain all my internship work on the X-Delta Robot.
- The controllers (OpenCR controller and ROS U2D2 controllers)
- The kinematic representation.
- The 3D SolidWorks modeling
- The URDF Visualisation
- The simulations
- The PID Tuning. 

# Controlling the robot
I will start by presenting the OpenCR Controller
- This is a full and easy-to-use controller for an X-Delta Robot with 3 dynamixel servos, using an OpenCR board
- I will explain the process step by step so everyone can implement the controller and use it.

## The hardware connection
- The OpenCR1.0 is a development board created by ROBOTIS for ROS systems to provide completely open-source hardware and software.
- The development environment for OpenCR1.0 is Arduino IDE.

- Our Robot uses 3 XL430-W250-T Servos, that support Daisy-Chain Communication; we control each DYNAMIXEL by sending data packets through a single shared communication bus, and every DYNAMIXEL can be connected to another DYNAMIXEL thus only one cable connection to the controller and power is required.

## Setting up the IDE
- After installing the Arduino IDE, we need to install the OpenCR Library so that we can program it.
- File > Preferences > Additional Boards Manager URLs
- Copy this link
```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/OpenCR/master/arduino/opencr_release/package_opencr_index.json
```
- We can now install the OpenCR Boad.

## Installing the libraries
- To set up the board, we need to install the OpenCR Library, which contains the 2 libraries that we need: OpenManipulator library and RobotisManipulator library.

## Setting up the Board
- Open the open_manipulator_delta folder
- Upload the open_manipulator_delta.ino file to the OpenCR
